# Credit Card

Turn this comp into code!

Coding Requirements:

1. No jQuery!
2. Use whatever stack or build tools you want.
	a. Example: Handlebars, React, Webpack, Gulp, etc.
3. No Images outside of the "Visa", "Amex, "Mastercard" logos. Everything must be done in CSS.
4. Put this in a personal repo. Showcase your branching strategy, PR's, and commits.

Functionality Requirements:

1. Clicking on different Cards changes the "Current Balance" and list of transactions on the right.
	a. The Current Balance does not have to be exact. Just showcase the change.
	b. Ideally the transactions are different from Card to Card.

Bonus Points:

1. Bring any creative ideas you have to the table. Hover states, animations, etc.
2. The transactions you choose add up to the Current Balance.
3. Have more transactions than what's visible on the screen. Making the transactions pane scrollable.
4. Functionality to add a new Card to your Wallet.# code-challenge
